# AI-VFM
We present AI-VFM, a new vector flow mapping (VFM) method enabled by recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-VFM uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) encoding mass conservation, momentum balance, and boundary conditions to recover intraventricular flow and pressure fields from standard echocardiographic scans. AI-VFM performs phase unwrapping and recovers missing data in the form of spatial and temporal gaps in the input color-Doppler data, thereby producing super-resolution flow maps. AI-VFM is solely informed by each patient's flow physics;  it does not utilize explicit smoothness constraints or incorporate data from other patients or flow models. AI-VFM shows good validation against ground-truth data from CFD, outperforming traditional VFM methods as well as similar PINN-based VFM formulations relying exclusively on mass conservation.
